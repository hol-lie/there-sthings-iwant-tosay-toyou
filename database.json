        "When I was younger, about 5 years old, I remember feeling very alone at school. It was recess and I was walking around in a secluded part of the school. There was a little ditch, and I fell in it and scraped my knee. I remember how lonely I felt, but in that moment I looked down and saw the bruising and dirt and blood. I remember looking at it in awe. I remember feeling like I understood that my body was important in that moment, that it was all temporary. I remember feeling safe in that, I remember feeling like the world was kind",

And as I get older, I realize more and more that I‚Äôm like my dad and it makes that feeling come back. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a limbo between being happy and being angry. I‚Äôm angry at everything even if it makes me happy. I need out. I know death isn‚Äôt the answer, but is escapism and extreme maladaptive daydreaming either? At some point I‚Äôll be gone, my mind elsewhere and my body here. And I‚Äôll still be angry because Im just like my father and it‚Äôll be the death of me.",
        "My happiest day is primarily based around food! Wake up at a decent time, get coffee. Get a good lunch with the girlies. Plan our night out, get ready together, have a chill night and be in bed before midnight! ",

        "I like to think of love as a mutual understanding of one another on a deeper level. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to intimate relationships but all kinds. Just a general understanding of another‚Äôs beings comforts, desires, boundaries, needs, and other mushy sappy things like that. But I would also say sharing your edibles with someone is an equally if not more valid expression of love.",
        "I still haven‚Äôt watched stranger things, and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. It‚Äôs not like it doesn‚Äôt look good or anything, it looks great and I‚Äôve heard only good things about it. I do t know I just have no internal desire to watch it. I‚Äôll always say ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs definitely on my list‚Äù but I just don‚Äôt. Some of my best friends will swear by the show and one time my coworker said I looked like that Steve character(the really sexy one with the good hair that wore the sailor outfit, not to say that I‚Äôm really sexy but I knew the character I it made me feel really good about myself when they said it because I think the guy who plays him is really hot and charming(I do think I have really nice hair though)) so I want to want to watch it but anytime I think about it I just watch through arrested development again.",
